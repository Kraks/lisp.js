# Lisp.js

Inspired by Peter Norvig's [Lisp.py](http://norvig.com/lispy.html), I take two days and wrote a tiny but powerful lisp interpreter in JavaScript.

I improved arithmetic operator to support multiple parameter calculations, such as `(add 1 2 3 4)`, and added some syntax sugars like `let`, `let*`, `cond`, `else`, `and` and `or`. 

Now it could interpret a Y combinator!

Have fun!
