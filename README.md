# Lisp.js

Inspired by Peter Norvig's [Lisp.py](http://norvig.com/lispy.html), I take two days and wrote a tiny lisp interpreter in JavaScript.

Meanwhile, I added support of `let`, `let*`, `cond`, `else`, `and`, `or` and some other syntax sugar. Now it could interpret a Y combinator!

Dependencies: [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org)

Have fun!
